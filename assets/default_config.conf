# Source a file (containing aliases, variables, etc)

# Define commands
# Start with a morse sequence (at least two characters)
# After the sequence, add the command to execute
# .   -->  short click
# -   -->  long click

# Note: Do NOT conditionally define commands like this:
# if CONDITION; then
#   .-.- my_command
# fi
#
# ^ BAD!
#
# Morse sequence commands are always parsed.
# This code would compile, but the morse command would be extracted out of
# the if statement anyway by the parser and made available to be triggered.
